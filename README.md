The data sets are found at:

Please see the "read_in_data_and_query.py" file for item number 3 in the first lesson.  This is just me playing around with selecting columns, filtering, etc etc etc.

I added the decision_tree_classifier.py to choose the features I want to train on, deal with null values, split out test set from training set, train up a decision tree classifier, visualize it, and create predictions.
