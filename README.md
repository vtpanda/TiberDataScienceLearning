The data sets are found at:

Titanic: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

Telco: https://community.watsonanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

The decision_tree_classifier.py file is the main file I'm working with to create and use the decision tree.

The read_in_data_and_query.py file was just me playing around with selecting columns, filtering, etc etc etc.
